# Interview Scheduler

Interview Scheduler is a simple, single-page appointment maker. Users are able to toggle through days in the week, add, edit and delete appointments for a certain student and interviewer. The main focus for this project was the front-end development using React. Testing was done using Jest and Cypress.
